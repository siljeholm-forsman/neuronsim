# neuronsim
Software for simulating encoding and decoding information into a neuronal population with variable properties, as well as calculating decoding accuracy for this process.

The software is written in conjunction with the bachelor thesis ["The Impact of Noise when Decoding Information in Highly Curved Neuronal Encoding Manifolds" (2022)](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1700457&dswid=9212).
